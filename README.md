# Anti Distracted Driving App

In the Philippines, even using your phone while waiting at a traffic light is already a violation of RA 10913 (Anti-Distracted Driving Act) and is punishable with up to 30,000 pesos in fines.

With ADDA (Anti-Distracted Driving App), you can turn ON safe driving mode to mute notifications, block incoming calls, and auto-send an SMS to incoming calls.
